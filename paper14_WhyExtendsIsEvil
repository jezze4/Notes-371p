Interfaces versus Classes
	- implementation inheritance (extends) < interface inheritance (implements)
Losing Flexibility
	- rather than implement features you might need, you implement only the features you definitely need.

Coupling
	- undesirable reliance of one part of a program on another part
	- object's instance variables should always be PRIVATE

	- one solution is to override methods that lead to unwanted effects
		- have it throw an exception
	- eliminate fragile base classes by using interfaces
Frameworks
	- half-baked classes that depend on derived classes for complete functionality (Java's Component's paint() method
