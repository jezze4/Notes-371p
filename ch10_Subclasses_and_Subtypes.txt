					CHAPTER 10: SUBCLASSES AND SUBTYPES
	
10.0 Prelogue
	-subclass
		- asserts that one class has been built using inheritance of another class
		- built using an existing class as basis
			- in Java: using -extends-
	-subtype
					
10.1 Substitutability
	- in static OOP languages, the type associated with a -value- held by variable may not match type associated with -declaration- for that variable
		- in Billiards Case Study, a GraphicalObject held value of type Ball, Wall, or Hole
		- Integer can never hold a String though
	- Substitution (Subsumption)
		- variable declared as a parent class can hold a value that in instance of child class
		
10.2 Subtypes
	- types
		- hold certain values
			- int can hold 2^(-31) to 2^(31)-1		(-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
		- can perform certain operations
			- (int can perform add, subtract, multiply, division)
		- satisfy properties
			- ints can't hold fractional values so it truncates them
	- abstract data type (ADT)
		- stack
			- in Java, first step of use of ADT is definition of an interface
	
	--SYNTAX VERSUS SEMANTICS--
		- syntax deals with how statements can be written
		   just as subclasses deal with how a class is declared
		- semantics deals with what a statement means
		   just as subtypes deal with how a child class preserves meaning of parent class
	
	-subtype
		- a new class is subtype of existing class
			- assert new class provides all existing class operations and furthermore satisfies properties associated with the class
			
	--TYPES ARE A POOR MAN'S SPECIFICATIONS--
		-types used to eliminate typing errors
		-advantages of types
			- they are useful approximation
			- simple to explain
			- easy to check
		- formal specification difficult to write and explain
		- types by comparison almost trivial for compiler to check
		
10.3 The Substitutability Paradox

10.4 Subclassing for Construction

10.5 Dynamically Typed Languages

*10.6 Pre- and Postconditions

*10.7 Refinement Semantics
	- refinement
		- child class adds to behavior but does not replace it
