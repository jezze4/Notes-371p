Chapter 7: A Billiards Game

7.1 ELEMENTS OF BILLIARDS
	mouse position, energy of ball once hit, change direction when collide against wall or other.


7.2 GRAPHICAL OBJECTS
			graphical objects
				link field and field saying the space it occupies  on screen	

	7.2.1 THE WALL GRAPHICAL OBJECT
			drawing of the wall
			conversion factor = 0 or pi depending on orientation of wall. used to change direction of collided ball

	7.2.2 THE HOLE GRAPHICAL OBJECT
			hole struck by ball
				if cue ball, placed back into play in a fixed location
				else, it's another ball. energy -> 0. placed in special display area
				
	7.2.3 THE BALL GRAPHICAL OBJECT
			direction (radians) (initial = 0)
			energy (real value) (initial = 0)		
			method: update. updates position of ball
			updates to hitting walls, holes, or other balls
			hit another ball: energy of first is split and half is given to 2nd ball
				also changes angle
				
				
7.3 THE MAIN PROGRAM
			control is decentralized into different classes/objects
			mouse click provides energy, then passed into interaction of balls
			
7.4 USING INHERITANCE
			defining a general class for "graphical objects" 
				includes walls, holes, and balls
			ball, wall, hole as subclasses of GraphicalObject
			virtual and abstract
				not defined in parent class but must be redefined in child class
			virtual but not abstract
				such as update: declared in ball class, but not other two
			graphical objects can now be kept in a single linked list
			polymorphism
				one function call might result in many different function bodies being invoked
