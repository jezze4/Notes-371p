Pair Programming

share everything
	blame and success

play fair
	person not coding think if it's a good strategy, or come up with a better one
	take turns on keyboard
	
dont hit people
	no distractions
	
Put things back where they belong
	steer clear of negative thoughts - either bad about yourself or bad about your partner/others
	
clean up your mess
	partners detect your defects in coding when you don't

dont take things too seriously
	ego-less programming. but enough to spark a healthy debate/disagreement
	
say you're sorry when you hurt somebody
	communicate enough to improve. set up an appropriate workspace environment
	
wash your hands before you start
	jelled team: whole greater than sum of parts
	go into pair programming without skepticism
	
Flush
	review work done independently
	
warm cookies adn cold milk are good for you
	take breaks
	
live a balanced life
	informal chat around the area can help with ideas; chat with others for effective idea exchange
	
take a nap every afternoon
	work alone from tim to time

watch out for traffic out in the world
	trust each other; no competition
	
be aware of wonder
	realize other's skills. people view things differently
	
FINAL THOUGHTS
	pair programming is effective
	programmers are initially conditioned to work alone, so transition can take a while
