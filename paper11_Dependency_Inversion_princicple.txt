				Dependency Inversion Principle
				
A. HIGH LEVEL MODULES SHOULD NOT DEPEND UPON LOW LEVEL MODULES. BOTH SHOULD DEPEND UPON ABSTRACTIONS.

B. ABSTRACTIONS SHOULD NOT DEPEND UPON DETAILS. DETAILS SHOULD DEPEND UPON ABSTRACTIONS

"all well structured object-oriented architectures have clearly-defined layers, with each layer providing some coherent set of services though a well-defined and controlled interface" - Booch

Dependency is transitive

Seperating Interface from Implementation in c++
	In C++ however, there is no separation between interface and implementation. Rather, in C++, the
	separation is between the definition of the class and the definition of its member functions
		- .h module
			- contains definition of the class
		- .cc module
			- contains definition of class's member functions
