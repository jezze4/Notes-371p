most sw dev chaotic activity = "code and fix"

engineering methodologies = plan-driven methodologies

agile methodologies
	less documentation for a given task
	code-oriented
	adaptive rather than predictive 
	people-oriented rather than process-oriented

predictive vs adaptive
	design vs construction
		design takes intellect and planning; creativity
			unpredictable; requires expensive and creative people
		constructions takes less thinking and more doing
			predictable

		in software: all effort is design; requires creativity and talent
		creativity not predictable
